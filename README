INSTALLATION:

    To install, just copy src/iproute2 to /etc/bash_completion.d/iproute2.

    Some day we may add a Makefile to generate .deb and/or .rpm packages; feel
    free to add it, of course.

BUGS:

    If you miss an expected word like "dev", the parser may become confused.

    Where completions aren't implemented for a particular state, it spits out
    noisy debugging messages. (Ordinary users probably won't want these.)

    Completions for some subcommands are not implemented yet.

    Hostnames are legal where addresses are expected, but tabcompletion does
    not cope with them. It doesn't even read from /etc/hosts.

    When the current word has a colon in it, bash uses the text returned by the
    tabcompletion function and appends it after the last colon, rather than
    replacing the whole word. This makes it particularly tricky to tabcomplete
    IPv6 addresses.  We work around this, but it might break in future.

    Some things really don't have sensible completions, but we try anyway.
